  summary: LSB release detection module for Debian
  description: |
    Intro
    -----

    This conda package provides the `lsb_release` command for Debian-based Linux
    distributions such as Debian and Ubuntu. It provides a simple command-line interface
    for accessing metadata about the installed Linux distribution.

    Motivation
    ----------

    Installation instructions for many Linux programs rely on the `lsb_release` command
    to detect the release number and/or codename of the installed Linux distribution.
    For example, as of the time of writing,
    [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/linux/ubuntu/) uses
    the `lsb_release -cs` command to detect the proper codename for the apt repository.

    The Debian-based
    [lsb-release package](https://packages.debian.org/stable/lsb-release)
    unfortunately depends on a system-wide installation of `python3`. This conda
    package avoids the need for a system-wide installation of `python3` when a conda
    environment is already available. The distribution-specific data is comes from
    a tiny system package named
    [distro-info-data](https://packages.debian.org/stable/distro-info-data),
    which can be installed with `apt-get install -y distro-info-data`.

    Examples
    --------

    Bash:
    ```bash
    sudo apt-get install -y distro-info-data
    mamba install -y lsb-release
    lsb_release -a
    ```

    (Substitute `conda` for `mamba` above in case you use that instead.)

    Docker:
    ```dockerfile
    FROM condaforge/mambaforge:4.10.1-0

    RUN : \
        # Install distro-info-data and clean up.
        && apt-get update \
        && apt-get install -y distro-info-data \
        && rm -rf /var/lib/apt/lists/* \
        # Install lsb-release and clean up.
        && mamba install -y lsb-release \
        && conda clean -afy \
    ;

    # Print release information.
    RUN lsb_release -a
    ```
